# SCons Series Accompanying Repository

This repository contains example project used along my [SCons series](http://www.ostricher.com/tag/scons/) in [my blog](http://www.ostricher.com/).

This example project uses a simple C++ project, to demonstrate configuring SCons to build a multi-module project with a separate build directory, as described in [a post in the SCons series](http://www.ostricher.com/2014/09/scons-multi-module-with-build-dir).
