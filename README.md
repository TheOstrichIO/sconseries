# SCons Series Accompanying Repository

This repository contains example project used along my [SCons series](http://www.ostricher.com/tag/scons/) in [my blog](http://www.ostricher.com/).

This example project uses a simple C++ project with multi-flavor SCons setup, and adds a flavor activation script to simplify things further when working in the terminal, as described in [a post in the SCons series](http://www.ostricher.com/2014/10/scons-flavors-terminal-integration).
