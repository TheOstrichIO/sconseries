# SCons Series Accompanying Repository

This repository contains example project used along my [SCons series](http://www.ostricher.com/tag/scons/) in [my blog](http://www.ostricher.com/).

This example project uses a simple C++ project, and adds support for the SCons silent and help flags, as described in [a post in the SCons series](http://www.ostricher.com/2015/01/scons-help-quiet).
