# SCons Series Accompanying Repository

This repository contains example project used along my [SCons series](http://www.ostricher.com/tag/scons/) in [my blog](http://www.ostricher.com/).

This example project uses a simple C++ project with [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/), and uses Protoc builder to build it with SCons, as described in [a post in the SCons series](http://www.ostricher.com/2015/02/scons-protoc-builder).
