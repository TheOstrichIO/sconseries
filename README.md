# SCons Series Accompanying Repository

This repository contains example project used along my [SCons series](http://www.ostricher.com/tag/scons/) in [my blog](http://www.ostricher.com/).

This example project uses a simple C++ project, to demonstrate how to create SCons shortcuts to extremely simplify SConscripts, as described in [a post in the SCons series](http://www.ostricher.com/2014/10/scons-extreme-sconscript-simplification).
